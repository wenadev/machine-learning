## Predicting Fuel Consumption using Deep Neural Network

The program:
- Trains a poor deep neural network (DNN) model that predicts the target variable (MPG) by deliberately overfitting the training data. 
- Generates a graph that depicts loss and performance metric (mean absolute percentage & mean absolute error) for both the training and the validation sets.
