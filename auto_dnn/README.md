## Predicting Fuel Consumption using Deep Neural Network

The program:
- Trains a poor deep neural network (DNN) model using 
keras.models.Sequential to predict mpg in such a way that the model intentionally overfits 
the training data usin 100 epochs. 
- Generates a graph that depicts loss and performance metric 
(e.g., mse, mae, or other) for both the training and the validation sets. 

## Poor model

## Good model

- Improves the model from (d) by changing some hyperparameters using 100 epochs. 
- Generates a second graph that depicts loss and 
performance metric for both the training and the validation sets.
