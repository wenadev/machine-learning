<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Hard Voting

The program:

- Trains a ‘hard’ Voting Classifier that includes the following models and prints their accuracy on the testing data:

 - Gaussian Naïve Bayes
 - Support Vector Machine (gamma=0.5, C=100)
 - Decision Tree Classifier (max_depth=5)

## Bagging Classifier

The program:

- Trains a Bagging Classifier ensemble using 100 Decision Tree estimators
- Prints their accuracy on the ‘out of bag’ samples and on the testing data
